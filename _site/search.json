In this capacity I lead a team of consultants, managers, and analysts to generate actionable insights that drive strategic decision-making. I am responsible for testing products, ETLs, and new features, as well as ensuring quality control and debugging for optimal performance. Additionally, I manage all analytics-related deliverables, including analyses, reports, training materials, and executive-level presentations and Q&A sessions.\r\nThe 2022 merger of IRI and the NPD Group helped propel the new combined organization even higher in the echelons of global market research firms.My expertise in market research consulting spans multiple business verticals, including technology, CPG, retail, media, and general merchandise. I specialize in generating insights through both quantitative methods—such as big data analytics, predictive modeling, and forecasting—and qualitative approaches, including surveys, focus groups, and consumer behavior analysis.\r\nCoding and Machine Learning\r\nBeyond my leadership responsibilities, I remain deeply engaged in the hands-on aspects of data science. Whenever possible, I take on coding projects to refine and expand my technical skills. In my day-to-day work, I frequently leverage tools such as SQL, SAS, and Python to explore data, develop models, and enhance analytics capabilities.\r\nI’m currently working to improve my Python skills and learning to deploy ML models within Databricks. I love learning but sometimes I get carried away and overestimate how productive I can be and enroll in way more Udemy, edX, and DataCamp courses than I can manage…\r\n\r\nOntario Provincial Police\r\nData Analysis\r\nDuring my tenure at the Ontario Provincial Police (Business Management Bureau), I primarily led the traffic portfolio, focusing on roadway fatalities, injuries, and collisions. In addition, I was actively involved in various data projects related to crime, personnel, and resource allocation.\r\nWhile much of my work remains classified, many crime and justice-related reports contributed by our unit can be found through the Statistics Canada website: raw data and as analyses.\r\nBusiness Operations\r\nTo enhance efficiency in reporting, I led the automation of existing Excel reports into Power BI dashboards, developed standardized SOPs, and created training materials, including videos and documentation.\r\nIn addition, I managed the finance and personnel statistics model used to determine the cost of OPP contracts for smaller municipalities and townships, incorporating various factors and key variables.\r\nI also oversaw 50% of the unit’s procurement operations, collaborating with vendors (including SAS) to identify optimal product packages, draft business cases, and manage contracts.\r\n\r\nUniversity of Chicago Crime Lab\r\nSDSC (Strategic Decision Support Center)\r\nDuring my time at the University of Chicago, I primarily worked on the SDSC Project — a collaborative smart policing initiative within the Chicago Police Department’s Bureau of Operations. Initially, I conducted crime and resource analyses for three CPD districts, providing data-driven insights and strategic recommendations to District Commanders. I also contributed in various capacities across multiple districts citywide.\r\nSubsequently, I served as the analyst for the Area South Deputy Chief while also taking on the role of ATC (Area Technology Center) Analyst for the Area South Detectives. The ATC, essentially the Bureau of Detectives’ counterpart to SDSC, operated with vastly distinct tools, equipment, and procedures.\r\nAfter my work in crime analytics, I transitioned to CPD Headquarters, where I contributed to projects focused on traffic, personnel management, and Consent Decree compliance.\r\nHere I am (top left), delivering a briefing to senior CPD staffUChicago articles regarding the history and background of the project: [history | overview | funding1 | funding2].\r\nResearch paper drafted by several of my colleagues containing more specific information on the project: [research paper]\r\nInternal evaluation and independent third party evaluation conducted by the RAND Corporation pertaining to the effectiveness and results of the project: [Crime Lab evaluation | RAND evaluation]\r\nSDSC was recognized by the Integrated Justice Information Systems (NJIS) Institute and received the 2021 Thomas J. O’Reilly Innovation Award at its 2021 National Symposium: [past award winners]\r\nCity of Chicago: Violence Reduction Dashboard\r\nA critical component of my work with the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor was leading the South Side data efforts for the Regional Coordination Meeting. This initiative brought together a diverse coalition of agencies and organizations—including UChicago Crime Lab (where I served as a representative), UChicago Medicine, the Chicago Police Department, the Chicago Mayor’s Office, the Chicago Department of Streets and Sanitation, the Chicago Park District, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, Chicago CRED, and numerous other public agencies and nonprofits—to address violent crime and related issues.\r\nAs part of these bi-weekly meetings, another analyst and I manually compiled a crime statistics report, tracking fatal shootings, non-fatal shootings, and non-shooting homicides. Recognizing the need for a more efficient and accessible approach, we developed the VR Dashboard, the first-ever public data dashboard launched by the City of Chicago. After six months of development, the dashboard went live on the city’s website, providing real-time crime analytics to stakeholders and the public.\r\nIn addition to co-developing the dashboard, I was responsible for producing monthly updates and troubleshooting newsletters, designing the cover page and base map, and leading training sessions and presentations for public agencies, outreach organizations, and other key stakeholders.\r\n\r\nA couple screenshots of the dashboard, made in Tableau and Tableau PrepAs of May 27th, 2021, the VR Dashboard is officially open to the public:\r\nTo access the website: [Dashboard]\r\nTo access the data source: [Chicago Data Portal]\r\nFor details directly from the Office of the Mayor: [Mayor’s Press Release | VR Dashboard Use of Terms Agreement]\r\nTo see what the media is saying about this innovative tool: [CBS | FOX | MSN | Smart Cities World | The Chicago Defender]\r\nChicago Police Dept. Consent Decree\r\nI had the opportunity to work on several projects under the Consent Decree, a federal mandate issued by the U.S. Department of Justice to reform law enforcement agencies. Prior to its implementation in Chicago in 2017, the Consent Decree had been enforced in multiple police departments across the country, including the LAPD, Seattle PD, and NOPD.\r\nMy work focused on key areas such as strengthening community-police relations, enhancing resource and patrol efficiency, and analyzing personnel data—particularly regarding absences and furlough trends—to support informed policy decisions.\r\nFor background information on Chicago Police Consent Decree: [Illinois Attorney General | CPD Independent Monitor Team | City of Chicago]\r\nTo view CPD’s internal tracking of the consent decree progress: [Dashboard]\r\n\r\nParticipated Conferences\r\nI have also attended a number of law enforcement and analytics conferences, including the Tableau Conference (2019), the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference (2019), the Crimefighters Conference 2018, and the American Society of Criminology Annual Meeting (2015).\r\nPosing with my lovely colleagues from UChicago and CPDMe at the Tableau 2019 Data Night Out… after a complimentary makeupIf you’re interested in Tableau events and conferences please click here [Tableau Events]\r\nAt the 2018 Crimefighters Conference, my team and I presented innovative data visualizations using Tableau dashboards and introduced new approaches to smart policing. Our presentation was delivered to an audience representing over 25 law enforcement agencies and a judging panel that included the former Chief of Technical Services for the Chicago Police Department and the former Deputy Chief of Detectives for the LAPD.\r\nA colleague presenting my analytical report to showcase the smart policing aspect of the SDSC\r\n\r\n\r\n",
