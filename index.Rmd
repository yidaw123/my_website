<b> <font size="+2"> Welcome to my website! </font> </b>

I'm currently a Senior Data Science Manager II at [Circana](https://www.circana.com/) (formerly IRI and the NPD Group), one of the world's leading market research consulting firms. I lead a high-performing team of consultants, managers, and analysts. Together, we harness forecasting, machine learning, and advanced analytics to deliver actionable insights that drive strategic decision-making for global clients.

Before transitioning to the private sector, I worked as a Statistician for [the Ontario Ministry of the Solicitor General](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-solicitor-general)'s law enforcement branch - [the Ontario Provincial Police](https://www.opp.ca/). Prior to that, I was a Project Manager and an Embedded Research Analyst at [the University of Chicago Crime & Education Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/) where I consulted for the Chicago Police Department, the Chicago Mayor's Office, and various public agencies and outreach organizations. My work focused on data analytics, policy analysis, and change management to support evidence-based decision-making. 

I thoroughly enjoy new challenges and experiences and am currently looking to dabble in entrepreneurship and start-ups especially within tech, B2C, and data analytics. If you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat more about my background, feel free to shoot me a message on Linkedin!
